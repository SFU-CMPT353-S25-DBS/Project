⚠️ Important! ⚠️
Before you commit to this repo, please run this command:

```
git config filter.strip-notebook-output.clean 'jupyter nbconvert --ClearOutputPreprocessor.enabled=True --to=notebook --stdin --stdout --log-level=ERROR'
```

This will make sure that the output of notebooks is not saved to the repo (we are working with large datasets and that will just take up space).

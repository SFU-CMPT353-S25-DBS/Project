# List of the project questions
This list is a collection of all the questions we thought of for the project. We majority voted for :
> Distance from where power is generated influence the number of blackouts a community experiences?

Bea :
- Do towns within X kilometres of a large body of water have more power outages than interior towns?
- Does Downtown Eastside have a higher than average number of outages compared to other Lower Mainland districts?
- Do the number of outages related to natural disasters significantly increase after extreme weather events (This is probably pretty easy)
- Can the cause of an outage be accurately predicted based on factors present within the dataset (location, number of affected customers, date, ...)
- they could also be "here's some finding, is it significant?"

Dorsa :
- Do the number of outages correlate with the area (meaning if the more disadvantaged that area is itâ€™s more likely to have outages)

Soumya : 
- Correlation between outages with big pop size and their causes being specific human activity
  - Examples of human activity : motor vehicle accidents, vandalism, etc
- Are specifc outages causes more common during particular season/time? Does its frequency increase at specifc time?
- Average response/resolve time for outages? For specfic causes?
- Most common outage occuring in municpality? are they mor eclustered in specicifc regions?
- Distance from where power is generated influence the number of blackouts a community experiences?

- This is a bit more sophisticated for the project, requiring more research from outside, however might be interesting for analysis.
  - In which municipalities do the outages from "equipment failure"/"fire" occur the most? Are they older municipalities? Are these people generally under represented? Is the maintanace low?
  - Do demographic factors correlate to the frequency of outages (downtown, income, education level, etc?)

> Substation faults : Equipment in a local sub station has failed. This could be due to a number of factors, including a weather-related issue or an issue with a piece of equipment. Google  - "stem from equipment failure due to aging, poor maintenance, overloading, or power surges, and can manifest as abnormal noises, overheating, vibrations, or tripped circuit breakers."
